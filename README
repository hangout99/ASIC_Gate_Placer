Run:
make; ./Placer < test

Features: 
Netlist to grid placement.
Half perimeter route estimation. 
True random numbers used. (Intel Ivy Bridge only)
Quick route length recalculation. 
Timeout, on stable values.
Visual ouput.

TODO List:
Better than half perimeter route estimation. 
Non-greedy algorithm, as to avoid getting stuck in vallies.
True net support (instead of current linked gates netlist).
Port support.
